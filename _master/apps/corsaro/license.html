                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
 &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/

A chiunque è permesso copiare e ridistribuire copie esatte di questo
documento di licenza, ma non è in alcun modo consentito apportarvi
modifiche.

                        PREAMBOLO

La GNU General Public License è una licenza libera e basata su
copyleft per software e altri tipi di opere. 

Le licenze della maggior parte del software e di altre opere
materiali sono pensate per togliere la libertà di condividere e
modificare tali opere. Al contrario, la GNU General Public License
ha l'obiettivo di garantire la libertà di condividere e modificare
tutte le versioni di un programma e di fare in modo che esso
rimanga software libero per tutti gli utenti. Noi, Free Software
Foundation, usiamo la GNU General Public License per la maggior
parte del nostro software; essa viene applicata anche a qualunque
altro software rilasciato dall'autore sotto questa licenza.
Chiunque può utilizzare questa licenza per i suoi programmi.

Quando parliamo di software libero (free software), ci riferiamo al
concetto di libertà, non al prezzo. Le nostre General Public
License sono progettate per garantire che chiunque abbia la libertà
di distribuire copie di software libero (anche dietro pagamento di
un prezzo, se lo desidera), che chiunque riceva o possa ricevere il
codice sorgente se lo vuole, che chiunque possa apportare modifiche
al software o utilizzarne delle porzioni in altri software liberi,
e che chiunque sappia che ha il diritto di fare tutte queste cose
col software libero.

Per proteggere i vostri diritti, abbiamo la necessità di impedire
che altri vi neghino questi diritti o vi obblighino a rinunciarvi.
Pertanto, chiunque distribuisce o modifica software rilasciato con
questa licenza assume dei precisi doveri: il dovere di rispettare
la libertà degli altri.

Per esempio, chi distribuisce copie di un programma rilasciato
sotto questa licenza, sia gratis che dietro pagamento di un prezzo,
e' obbligato a riconoscere a chi riceve il software esattamente gli
stessi diritti che ha ricevuto. Deve garantire che chi riceva il
software abbia o possa avere accesso al codice sorgente. E deve
chiaramente far conoscere ai destinatari del software queste
condizioni, così che essi conoscano quali sono i loro diritti.

Gli sviluppatori che usano la GNU GPL proteggono i vostri diritti in
due modi: (1) Rivendicando il copyright sul software, e (2)
offrendovi questa licenza che vi garantisce il diritto legale di
copiarlo e/o di modificarlo.

Al fine di proteggere gli sviluppatori e gli autori, la GPL spiega
chiaramente che non c'è nessuna garanzia per questo software
libero. Nell'interesse degli utenti e degli autori, la GPL impone
che le versioni modificate del software vengano esplicitamente
marcate come "modificate", in maniera tale che eventuali problemi
non vengano erroneamente attribuiti agli autori delle versioni
precedenti.

Alcuni dispositivi sono progettati per negare agli utenti
l'installazione o l'esecuzione di versioni modificate del software
che gira sugli stessi, anche se il costruttore si riserva la
possibilità di farlo. Ciò è fondamentalmente incompatibile con
l'obiettivo di garantire la libertà degli utenti di modificare il
software. Una ripetizione sistematica di tali abusi avviene nel
campo dei dispositivi per usi individuali, e ciò rende questi abusi
ancora più inaccettabili. Pertanto, abbiamo realizzato questa
versione della GPL al fine di proibire queste pratiche. Se problemi
simili dovessero sorgere in altri ambiti, saremo pronti ad
estendere queste misure a questi nuovi ambiti in versioni future
della GPL, nella maniera che si renderà necessaria per difendere la
libertà degli utenti.

In conclusione, tutti i programmi sono costantemente minacciati dai
brevetti sul software. Gli Stati non dovrebbero permettere ai
brevetti sul software di limitare lo sviluppo e l'utilizzo di
software per computer, ma nei Paesi in cui ciò avviene noi vogliamo
evitare in particolare il pericolo che i brevetti sul software
applicati ad un programma libero possano renderlo, a tutti gli
effetti, proprietario. Per impedire ciò, la GPL assicura che non è
possibile utilizzare i brevetti sul software per rendere un
programma non libero.

I termini e le condizioni esatte per la copia, la distribuzione e la
modifica del software sono riportate di seguito.

                    TERMINI E CONDIZIONI

0. Definizioni

    "Questa Licenza" si riferisce alla versione 3 della GNU General
    Public License.

    "Copyright" indica anche leggi simili al copyright che riguardano
    altri tipi di opere, come le maschere per la produzione di
    semiconduttori.

    "Il Programma" indica qualunque opera che sia soggetta a copyright e
    che sia rilasciata sotto questa Licenza. I detentori della licenza
    sono indicati come "tu" o "voi". Licenziatari e destinatari possono
    essere individui o organizzazioni.

    "Modificare" un'opera significa copiare o adattare tutta o parte
    dell'opera in una maniera che richieda un permesso di copyright, e
    non indica la semplice azione di fare una esatta copia dell'opera.
    L'opera risultante viene chiamata "versione modificata" dell'opera
    precedente, oppure viene detta opera "basata sulla" opera precedente.

    Un' "opera coperta da questa licenza" indica il Programma originale
    non modificato oppure un'opera basata sul Programma.

    "Propagare" un'opera significa fare qualunque cosa con essa che, in
    mancanza di un esplicito permesso, ti renda direttamente o
    indirettamente perseguibile per violazione secondo le vigenti
    normative sul copyright, ad eccezione della semplice esecuzione del
    Programma su un computer o della modifica di una copia privata. La
    Propagazione include la copia, la distribuzione (con o senza
    modifiche), la messa a disposizione al pubblico e, in alcuni stati,
    altre attività simili e connesse.

    "Distribuire" un'opera indica qualunque forma di propagazione che
    permetta a terze parti di effettuare o ricevere delle copie. La
    mera interazione con un utente attraverso una rete di computer,
    senza che ci sia alcun trasferimento di una copia, non è
    considerata "Distribuzione".

    Una interfaccia utente interattiva fornisce delle "Adeguate
    Informazioni Legali" soltanto nel caso in cui include una apposita
    funzionalità, resa adeguatamente visibile, che (1) visualizzi
    un'adeguata informazione di copyright, e (2) informi l'utente che
    non c'è alcuna garanzia sull'opera (eccetto nel caso in cui delle
    garanzie sono espressamente fornite), dica che il licenziatario può
    distribuire l'opera utilizzando questa Licenza, indichi come è
    possibile prendere visione di una copia di questa Licenza. Se
    l'interfaccia presenta una lista di comandi o di opzioni, come ad
    esempio un menù, una delle opzioni fornite nella lista deve
    rispettare questa condizione.

1. Codice Sorgente.

    Il "codice sorgente" di un'opera indica la forma più indicata
    dell'opera per effettuare modifiche su di essa. Il "codice oggetto"
    indica qualunque forma dell'opera che non sia codice sorgente.

    Una "Interfaccia Standard" è una interfaccia che risponde ad uno
    standard ufficiale definito da un ente di standardizzazione
    riconosciuto o, nel caso di interfacce specifiche per un
    particolare linguaggio di programmazione, una interfaccia che è
    largamente utilizzata dagli sviluppatori per sviluppare in tale
    linguaggio.

    Le "Librerie di Sistema" di un eseguibile includono qualsiasi cosa,
    eccetto l'opera nel suo insieme, che (a) sia inclusa nella normale
    forma di pacchettizzazione di un "Componente Principale", ma che
    non è parte di quel Componente Principale, e (b) che serva solo a
    consentire l'uso dell'opera con quel Componente Principale, o per
    implementare una Interfaccia Standard per la quale esista una
    implementazione disponibile al pubblico in forma sorgente. Un
    "Componente Principale", in questo contesto, è un componente
    essenziale (kernel, gestore di finestre eccetera) dello specifico
    sistema operativo (ammesso che ce ne sia uno) sul quale
    l'eseguibile esegue, o un compilatore utilizzato per produrre il
    programma, o un interprete di codice oggetto utilizzato per
    eseguire il programma.

    Il "Sorgente Corrispondente" per un'opera in forma di codice oggetto
    è il codice sorgente necessario per generare, installare e (per un
    programma eseguibile) eseguire il codice oggetto e per modificare
    l'opera, inclusi gli script per controllare le suddette attività di
    generazione, installazione ed esecuzione. Non sono incluse le
    Librerie di Sistema usate dal programma, o gli strumenti di utilità
    generica o i programmi liberamente accessibili che sono utilizzati,
    senza modifiche, per portare a termine le suddette attività ma che
    non fanno parte dell'opera. Per esempio, il sorgente corrispondente
    include i file con le definizioni delle interfacce associati ai
    file sorgente dell'opera, e il codice sorgente delle librerie
    condivise e sottoprogrammi collegati dinamicamente specificatamente
    necessari per il programma, ad esempio a causa di stretta
    comunicazione dati o di controllo di flusso tra questi
    sottoprogrammi e altre parti del programma.

    Il Sorgente Corrispondente non include qualunque cosa che l'utente
    possa rigenerare automaticamente da altre parti del Sorgente
    Corrispondente stesso.

    Il Sorgente Corrispondente di un'opera in forma di codice sorgente è
    l'opera stessa.

2. Principali Diritti

    Tutti i diritti garantiti da questa Licenza sono garantiti per la
    durata del copyright sul Programma, e sono irrevocabili ammesso che
    le suddette condizioni siano rispettate. Questa Licenza afferma
    esplicitamente il tuo permesso illimitato di eseguire il Programma
    non modificato. Il risultato dell'esecuzione di un programma
    coperto da questa Licenza è a sua volta coperto da questa Licenza
    solo se il risultato stesso, a causa del suo contenuto, è un'opera
    coperta da questa Licenza. Questa Licenza riconosce il tuo diritto
    all'uso legittimo o altri diritti equivalenti, come stabilito dalla
    legislazione sul copyright.

    Puoi creare, eseguire e propagare programmi coperti da questa
    Licenza che tu non distribuisci, senza alcuna condizione fino a
    quando la tua Licenza rimane valida. Puoi distribuire opere coperte
    da questa Licenza ad altri al solo scopo di ottenere che essi
    facciano delle modifiche al programma esclusivamente per te, o che
    ti forniscano dei servizi per l'esecuzione di queste opere, ammesso
    che tu rispetti i termini di questa Licenza nel distribuire tutto
    il materiale per il quale non detieni il copyright. Coloro i quali
    creano o eseguono per conto tuo un programma coperto da questa
    Licenza lo fanno esclusivamente in tua vece, sotto la tua direzione
    e il tuo controllo, in maniera tale che sia proibito a costoro
    effettuare copie di materiale di cui detieni il copyright al di
    fuori della relazione che intrattengono nei tuoi confronti.

    Distribuire opere coperte da licenza in qualunque altra circostanza
    è consentito soltanto alle condizioni espresse in seguito. Non è
    consentito sottolicenziare le opere: la sezione 10 lo rende non
    necessario.

3. Protezione dei diritti legali degli utenti 
   dalle leggi anti-elusione.

    Nessun programma protetto da questa Licenza può essere considerato
    parte di una misura tecnologica di restrizione che sottosta ad
    alcuna delle leggi che soddisfano l'articolo 11 del "WIPO copyright
    treaty" adottato il 20 Dicembre 1996, o a simili leggi che
    proibiscono o limitano l'elusione di tali misure tecnologiche di
    restrizione.

    Quando distribuisci un programma coperto da questa Licenza, rifiuti
    tutti i poteri legali atti a proibire l'elusione di misure
    tecnologiche di restrizione ammesso che tale elusione sia
    effettuata nell'esercizio dei diritti garantiti da questa Licenza
    riguardo al programma coperto da questa Licenza, e rinunci
    all'intenzione di limitare l'operatività o la modifica del
    programma per far valere, contro i diritti degli utenti del
    programma, diritti legali tuoi o di terze parti che impediscano
    l'elusione di misure tecnologiche di restrizione.

4. Distribuzione di Copie Esatte.

    Ti è permesso distribuire copie esatte del codice sorgente del
    Programma come lo hai ricevuto, con qualunque mezzo, ammesso che tu
    aggiunga in maniera appropriata su ciascuna copia una appropriata
    nota di copyright; che tu lasci intatti tutti gli avvisi che
    affermano che questa Licenza e tutte le clausole non-permissive
    aggiunte in accordo con la sezione 7 sono valide per il codice che
    distribuisci; che tu lasci intatti tutti gli avvisi circa l'assenza
    di garanzia; che tu fornisca a tutti i destinatari una copia di
    questa Licenza assieme al Programma.

    Puoi richiedere il pagamento di un prezzo o di nessun prezzo per
    ciascuna copia che distribuisci, e puoi offrire supporto o garanzia
    a pagamento.

5. Distribuzione di Versioni modificate del sorgente.

    Puoi distribuire un'opera basata sul Programma, o le modifiche per
    produrla a partire dal Programma, nella forma di codice sorgente
    secondo i termini della sezione 4, ammesso che tu rispetti anche
    tutte le seguenti condizioni:

    a. L'opera deve recare con sè delle informazioni adeguate che affermino
       che tu l'hai modificata, indicando la data di modifica.

    b. L'opera deve recare informazioni adeguate che affermino che essa è
       rilasciata sotto questa Licenza e sotto le condizioni aggiuntive
       secondo quanto indicato dalla Sezione 7. Questa condizione modifica
       la condizione espressa alla sezione 4 di "lasciare intatti tutti
       gli avvisi".

    c. Devi rilasciare l'intera opera, nel suo complesso, sotto questa
       Licenza a chiunque venga in possesso di una copia di essa. Questa
       Licenza sarà pertanto applicata, assieme ad eventuali clausole
       aggiunte in osservanza della Sezione 7, all'opera nel suo
       complesso, a tutte le sue parti, indipendentemente da come esse
       siano pacchettizzate. Questa Licenza nega il permesso di licenziare
       l'opera in qualunque altro modo, ma non rende nullo un tale
       permesso ammesso che tu lo abbia ricevuto separatamente.

    d. Se l'opera ha delle interfacce utente interattive, ciascuna deve
       mostrare delle Adeguate Informazioni Legali; altrimenti, se il
       Programma ha delle interfacce interattive che non visualizzano
       delle Adeguate Informazioni Legali, il tuo programma non è
       obbligato a visualizzarle.

    La giustapposizione di un'opera coperta da questa Licenza assieme ad
    altre opere separate e indipendenti, che non sono per loro natura
    estensioni del Programma, e che non sono combinate con esso a
    formare un altro programma più grande, dentro o in uno stesso
    supporto di memorizzazione a lungo termine o di distribuzione, è
    semplicemente detto "aggregato" se la raccolta e il suo copyright
    non sono utilizzati per limitare l'accesso o i diritti legali degli
    utenti della raccolta stessa oltre ciò che ciascun singolo
    programma consente. L'inclusione di un programma coperto da questa
    Licenza in un aggregato non comporta l'applicazione di questa
    Licenza alle altre parti dell'aggregato.

6. Distribuzione in formato non-sorgente.

    Puoi distribuire un programma coperto da questa Licenza in formato
    di codice oggetto secondo i termini delle sezioni 4 e 5, ammesso
    che tu fornisca anche il Sorgente Corrispondente in formato
    comprensibile da un computer sotto i termini di questa stessa
    Licenza, in uno dei seguenti modi:

    a. Distribuendo il codice oggetto in, o contenuto in, un prodotto
       fisico (inclusi i mezzi fisici di distribuzione), accompagnato dal
       Sorgente Corrispondente su un supporto fisico duraturo comunemente
       utilizzato per lo scambio di software.

    b. Distribuendo il codice oggetto in, o contenuto in, un prodotto
       fisico (inclusi i mezzi fisici di distribuzione), accompagnato da
       un'offerta scritta, valida per almeno tre anni e valida per tutto
       il tempo durante il quale tu offri ricambi o supporto per quel
       modello di prodotto, di fornire a chiunque possieda il codice
       oggetto (1) una copia del Sorgente Corrispondente di tutto il
       software contenuto nel prodotto che è coperto da questa Licenza, su
       un supporto fisico duraturo comunemente utilizzato per lo scambio
       di software, ad un prezzo non superiore al costo ragionevole per
       effettuare fisicamente tale distribuzione del sorgente, oppure (2)
       accesso alla copia del Sorgente Corrispondente attraverso un server
       di rete senza alcun costo aggiuntivo.

    c. Distribuendo copie singole del codice oggetto assieme ad una copia
       dell'offerta scritta di fornire il Sorgente Corrispondente. Questa
       possibilità è permessa soltanto occasionalmente e per fini non
       commerciali, e solo se tu hai ricevuto il codice oggetto assieme ad
       una tale offerta, in accordo alla sezione 6b.

    d. Distribuendo il codice oggetto mediante accesso da un luogo
       designato (gratis o dietro pagamento di un prezzo), e offrendo un
       accesso equivalente al Sorgente Corrispondente alla stessa maniera
       a partire dallo stesso luogo senza costi aggiuntivi. Non devi
       obbligare i destinatari a copiare il Sorgente Corrispondente
       assieme al codice oggetto. Se il luogo dal quale copiare il codice
       oggetto è un server di rete, il Sorgente Corrispondente può
       trovarsi su un server differente (gestito da te o da terze parti)
       che fornisca funzionalità equivalenti per la copia, a patto che tu
       fornisca delle indicazioni chiare accanto al codice oggetto che
       indichino dove trovare il Sorgente Corrispondente.
       Indipendentemente da quale server ospiti il Sorgente
       Corrispondente, tu rimani obbligato ad assicurare che esso rimanga
       disponibile per tutto il tempo necessario a soddisfare queste
       condizioni.
       
    e. Distribuendo il codice oggetto mediante trasmissione peer-to-peer, a
       patto che tu informi gli altri peer circa il luogo in cui il codice
       oggetto e il Sorgente Corrispondente sono gratuitamente offerti al
       pubblico secondo i termini della sezione 6d.

    Una porzione separabile del codice oggetto, il cui sorgente è
    escluso dal Sorgente Corrispondente e trattato come Libreria di
    Sistema, non deve essere obbligatoriamente inclusa nella
    distribuzione del codice oggetto del programma.

    Un "Prodotto Utente" è un (1) "prodotto consumer", cioè qualunque
    proprietà personale tangibile che è normalmente utilizzata per
    scopi personali, familiari o domestici, oppure (2) qualunque cosa
    progettata o venduta per essere utilizzata in ambiente domestico.
    Nella classificazione di un prodotto come "prodotto consumer", i
    casi dubbi andranno risolti in favore dell'ambito di applicazione.
    Per un dato prodotto ricevuto da un dato utente, "normalmente
    utilizzato" si riferisce ad un uso tipico o comune di quella classe
    di prodotti, indipendentemente dallo stato dell'utente specifico o
    dal modo in cui l'utente specifico utilizza, o si aspetta o ci si
    aspetta che utilizzi, il prodotto. Un prodotto è un "prodotto
    consumer" indipendentemente dal fatto che abbia usi commerciali,
    industriali o diversi da quelli "consumer", a meno che questi usi
    non rappresentino il solo modo utile di utilizzare il prodotto in
    questione.
    
    Le "Informazioni di Installazione" per un Prodotto Utente sono i
    metodi, le procedure, le chiavi di autorizzazioni o altre
    informazioni necessarie per installare ed eseguire versioni
    modificate di un programma coperto da questa Licenza all'interno di
    un Prodotto Utente, a partire da versioni modificate dei suoi
    Sorgenti Corrispondenti. Tali informazioni devono essere
    sufficienti ad assicurare che il funzionamento del codice oggetto
    modificato non sia in nessun caso proibito o ostacolato per il solo
    fatto che sono state apportate delle modifiche.

    Se distribuisci un codice oggetto secondo le condizioni di questa
    sezione in, o assieme, o specificatamente per l'uso in o con un
    Prodotto Utente, e la distribuzione avviene come parte di una
    transazione nella quale il diritto di possesso e di uso del
    Prodotto Utente viene trasferito al destinatario per sempre o per
    un periodo prefissato (indipendentemente da come la transazione sia
    caratterizzata), il Sorgente Corrispondente distribuito secondo le
    condizioni di questa sezione deve essere accompagnato dalle
    Informazioni di Installazione. Questa condizione non è richiesta se
    nè tu nè una terza parte ha la possibilità di installare versioni
    modificate del codice oggetto sul Prodotto Utente (ad esempio, se
    il programma è installato su una ROM)

    La condizione che richiede di fornire delle Informazioni di
    Installazione non implica che venga fornito supporto, garanzia o
    aggiornamenti per un programma che è stato modificato o installato
    dal destinatario, o per il Prodotto Utente in cui esso è stato
    modificato o installato. L'accesso ad una rete può essere negato se
    le modifiche apportate impattano materialmente sull'operatività
    della rete o se violano le regole e i protocolli di comunicazione
    attraverso la rete.

    Il Sorgente Corrispondente distribuito, e le Informazioni di
    Installazione fornite, in accordo con questa sezione, devono essere
    in un formato che sia pubblicamente documentato (e con una
    implementazione pubblicamente disponibile in formato di codice
    sorgente), e non devono richiedere speciali password o chiavi per
    essere spacchettate, lette o copiate.

7. Condizioni Aggiuntive.

    Le "Condizioni Aggiuntive" sono condizioni che completano le
    condizioni di questa Licenza permettendo delle eccezioni a una o
    più delle condizioni sopra elencate. Le condizioni aggiuntive che
    sono applicabili all'intero Programma devono essere considerate
    come se fossero incluse in questa Licenza, a patto che esse siano
    valide secondo le normative vigenti. Se alcune condizioni
    aggiuntive fanno riferimento soltanto ad alcune parti del
    Programma, quelle parti possono essere utilizzate separatamente
    sotto le stesse condizioni, ma l'intero Programma rimane sottoposto
    a questa Licenza senza riferimento ad alcuna condizione aggiuntiva.

    Quando distribuisci una copia di un programma coperto da questa
    Licenza, puoi, a tua discrezione, eliminare qualunque condizione
    aggiuntiva dalla copia, o da parte di essa. (Le Condizioni
    Aggiuntive possono essere scritte in maniera tale da richiedere la
    loro rimozione in certi casi di modifica del Programma). Puoi
    aggiungere Condizioni Aggiuntive su materiale, aggiunto da te ad
    un'opera coperta da questa Licenza, per il quale hai o puoi
    garantire un'adeguata licenza di copyright.

    Indipendentemente da qualunque altra condizione di questa Licenza, e
    per il materiale che aggiungi ad un'opera coperta da questa
    Licenza, puoi (se autorizzato dai legittimi detentori del copyright
    per il suddetto materiale) aggiungere alle condizioni di questa
    Licenza delle condizioni che:

    a. Negano la garanzia o limitano la responsabilità del Programma in
       maniera differente da quanto riportato nelle sezioni 15 e 16 di
       questa Licenza; oppure

    b. Richiedono il mantenimento di specifiche e circostanziate
       informative legali o di note di attribuzione ad autori nel
       materiale o assieme alle Adeguate Informazioni Legali mostrate dal
       Programma che lo contiene; oppure
    
    c. Proibiscono di fornire informazioni errate o ingannevoli
       sull'origine e la provenienza del materiale in oggetto, o
       richiedono che versioni modificate di tale materiale siano
       appositamente marcate in maniera differente rispetto alla versione
       originale; oppure
    
    d. Limitano l'utilizzo per scopi pubblicitari del nome dei detentori
       del copyright o degli autori del materiale; oppure
       
    e. Rifiutano di garantire diritti secondo le leggi sulla proprietà
       intellettuale circa l'uso di nomi, marchi di fabbrica o similari;
       oppure
    
    f. Richiedono l'indennizzo dei detentori del copyright o degli autori
       del materiale in oggetto da parte di chi distribuisce il materiale
       (o versioni modificate dello stesso) con impegni contrattuali circa
       la responsabilità nei confronti del destinatario, per qualunque
       responsabilità che questi impegni contrattuali dovessero imporre
       direttamente ai suddetti detentori del copyright e autori.

    Tutte le altre condizioni addizionali non-permissive sono
    considerate "ulteriori restrizioni", secondo il significato
    specificato alla sezione 10. Se il Programma o parti di esso
    contengono, all'atto della ricezione dello stesso, informative che
    specificano che esso è soggetto a questa Licenza assieme ad una
    condizione che è una "ulteriore restrizione", puoi rimuovere
    quest'ultima condizione. Se un documento di licenza contiene
    ulteriori restrizioni ma permette di rilicenziare o distribuire il
    Programma con questa Licenza, puoi aggiungere al Programma del
    materiale coperto dalle condizioni di quel documento di licenza, a
    patto che le ulteriori restrizioni non compaiano nelle versioni
    rilicenziate o ridistribuite.
    
    Se aggiungi ad un Programma coperto da questa Licenza delle
    condizioni aggiuntive in accordo con questa sezione, devi
    aggiungere anche, nei file sorgenti corrispondenti, un avviso che
    riassuma le condizioni aggiuntive applicate a quei file, ovvero un
    avviso che specifichi dove è possibile trovare copia delle
    condizioni aggiunte.

    Tutte le Condizioni aggiuntive, permissive o non-permissive, devono
    essere espresse nella forma di una licenza scritta e separata, o
    espresse esplicitamente come eccezioni; in entrambi i casi valgono
    le condizioni succitate.

8. Cessazione di Licenza

    Non puoi propagare o modificare un programma coperto da questa
    Licenza in maniera diversa da quanto espressamente consentito da
    questa Licenza. Qualunque tentativo di propagare o modificare
    altrimenti il Programma è nullo, e provoca l'immediata cessazione
    dei diritti garantiti da questa Licenza (compresi tutte le
    eventuali licenze di brevetto garantite ai sensi del terzo
    paragrafo della sezione 11).

    In ogni caso, se cessano tutte le violazioni di questa Licenza,
    allora la tua licenza da parte di un dato detentore del copyright
    viene ripristinata (a) in via cautelativa, a meno che e fino a
    quando il detentore del copyright non cessa esplicitamente e
    definitivamente la tua licenza, e (b) in via permanente se il
    detentore del copyright non ti notifica in alcun modo la violazione
    entro 60 giorni dalla cessazione della licenza.

    Inoltre, la tua licenza da parte di un dato detentore del copyright
    viene ripristinata in maniera permanente se il detentore del
    copyright ti notifica la violazione in maniera adeguata, se questa
    è la prima volta che ricevi una notifica di violazione di questa
    Licenza (per qualunque Programma) dallo stesso detentore di
    copyright, e se rimedi alla violazione entro 30 giorni dalla data
    di ricezione della notifica di violazione.

    La cessazione dei tuoi diritti come specificato in questa sezione
    non provoca la cessazione delle licenze di terze parti che abbiano
    ricevuto copie o diritti da te secondo questa Licenza. Se i tuoi
    diritti cessano e non sono ristabiliti in via permanente, non hai
    diritto di ricevere nuove licenze per lo stesso materiale, secondo
    quanto stabilito nella sezione 10.

9. L'ottenimento di copie non richiede 
   l'accettazione della Licenza

    Non sei obbligato ad accettare i termini di questa Licenza al solo
    fine di ottenere o eseguire una copia del Programma. Similmente,
    propagazioni collaterali di un Programma coperto da questa Licenza
    che occorrono come semplice conseguenza dell'utilizzo di
    trasmissioni peer-to-peer per la ricezione di una copia non
    richiedono l'accettazione della Licenza. In ogni caso, solo e
    soltanto questa Licenza ti garantiscono il permesso di propagare e
    modificare qualunque programma coperto da questa Licenza. Queste
    azioni violano le leggi sul copyright nel caso in cui tu non
    accetti questa Licenza. Pertanto, modificando o propagando un
    programma coperto da questa Licenza, indichi implicitamente la tua
    accettazione della Licenza.

10. Licenza Automatica per i successivi destinatari

    Ogni qual volta distribuisci un programma coperto da questa Licenza,
    il destinatario riceve automaticamente una licenza, dal detentore
    originario del copyright, di eseguire, modificare e propagare il
    programma, nel rispetto di questa Licenza. Non sei ritenuto
    responsabile del rispetto di questa Licenza da parte di terze parti.

    Una "transazione d' entità" è una transazione che trasferisce il
    controllo di una organizzazione, o sostanzialmente di tutti i suoi
    beni, che suddivide una organizzazione o che fonde più
    organizzazioni. Se la propagazione di un programma coperto da
    questa Licenza è conseguente ad una transazione di entità, ciascuna
    parte che ha ruolo nella transazione e che riceve una copia del
    programma riceve allo stesso tempo qualsiasi licenza sul programma
    che i predecessori della parte possedevano o potevano rilasciare
    nel rispetto del paragrafo precedente, e in più il diritto di
    possesso del Sorgente Corrispondente del programma dal predecessore
    in interesse, se il predecessore lo possiede o se può ottenerlo
    senza troppe difficoltà.

    Non puoi imporre nessuna ulteriore restrizione sull'esercizio dei
    diritti garantiti o affermati da questa Licenza. Per esempio, non
    puoi imporre un prezzo di licenza, una royalty, o altri costi per
    l'esercizio dei diritti garantiti da questa Licenza, a non puoi dar
    corso ad una controversia (ivi incluse le controversie incrociate o
    la difesa in cause legali) affermando che siano stati violati dei
    brevetti a causa della produzione, dell'uso, della vendita, della
    messa in vendita o dell'importazione del Programma o di sue parti.

11. Brevetti.

    Un "contribuente" è un detentore di copyright che autorizza l'uso
    secondo questa Licenza di un Programma o di un'opera basata sul
    Programma. L'opera così licenziata viene chiamata "versione del
    contribuente".

    I "diritti essenziali di brevetto" da parte di un contribuente sono
    tutti i diritti di brevetto che appartengono o che sono controllati
    dal contribuente, che siano già acquisiti o che saranno acquisiti
    in futuro, che possano essere violati in qualche maniera,
    consentita da questa Licenza, generando, modificando o vendendo la
    versione del contribuente, ma non includono i diritti che possano
    essere violati soltanto come conseguenza di ulteriori modifiche
    alla versione del contribuente. In relazione a questa definizione,
    il termine "controllo" include il diritto di garantire sottolicenze
    di brevetto in maniera consistente con le condizioni di questa
    Licenza.

    Ciascun contribuente ti garantisce la licenza di brevetto sui
    diritti essenziali di brevetto del contribuente stesso
    non-esclusiva, valida in tutto il mondo, esente da royalty, di
    creare, usare, vendere, offrire in vendita, importare e altrimenti
    eseguire, modificare e propagare i contenuti della versione del
    contribuente.

    Nei tre paragrafi successivi, con "licenza di brevetto" si intende
    qualunque accordo o contratto, comunque denominato, di non
    rivendicazione di un brevetto (come ad esempio un permesso
    esplicito di utilizzare un brevetto o un accordo di rinuncia alla
    persecuzione per violazione di brevetto). "Garantire" una tale
    licenza di brevetto ad una parte significa portare a termine un
    tale accordo o contratto di non rivendicazione di brevetto contro
    la parte.

    Se distribuisci un programma coperto da questa Licenza, confidando
    consapevolmente su una licenza di brevetto, e il Sorgente
    Corrispondente per il programma non è reso disponibile per la
    copia, senza alcun onere aggiuntivo e comunque nel rispetto delle
    condizioni di questa Licenza, attraverso un server di rete
    pubblicamente accessibile o tramite altri mezzi facilmente
    accessibili, allora devi (1) fare in modo che il Sorgente
    Corrispondente sia reso disponibile come sopra, oppure (2) fare in
    modo di rinunciare ai benefici della licenza di brevetto per quel
    particolare programma, oppure (3) adoperarti, in maniera
    consistente con le condizioni di questa Licenza, per estendere la
    licenza di brevetto a tutti i destinatari successivi. "Confidare
    consapevolmente" significa che tu sei attualmente cosciente che,
    eccettuata la licenza di brevetto, la distribuzione da parte tua di
    un programma protetto da questa Licenza in un paese, o l'utilizzo
    in un paese del programma coperto da questa Licenza da parte di un
    destinatario, può violare uno o più brevetti in quel paese che tu
    hai ragione di ritenere validi.

    Se, come conseguenza o in connessione con una singola transazione o
    con un dato accordo, distribuisci, o fai in modo di distribuire, un
    programma coperto da questa Licenza, e garantisci una licenza di
    brevetto per alcune delle parti che ricevono il Programma
    autorizzandole ad utilizzare, propagare, modificare o distribuire
    una specifica copia del Programma, allora la licenza di brevetto
    che fornisci è automaticamente estesa a tutti i destinatari del
    Programma coperto da questa Licenza e delle opere basate sul
    Programma.

    Una licenza di brevetto è "discriminatoria" se non include
    nell'ambito della sua copertura, proibisce l'esercizio, o è
    vincolata al non-esercizio di uno o più dei diritti che sono
    specificatamente garantiti da questa Licenza. Non puoi distribuire
    un Programma coperto da questa Licenza se sei parte di un accordo
    con una terza parte la cui attività comprende la distribuzione di
    software, secondo il quale tu sei costretto ad un pagamento alla
    parte terza in funzione della tua attività di distribuzione del
    Programma, e in conseguenza del quale la parte terza garantisce, a
    qualunque delle parti che riceveranno il Programma da te, una
    licenza di brevetto discriminatoria (a) assieme a copie del
    Programma coperto da questa Licenza distribuite da te (o ad altre
    copie fatte da codeste copie), oppure (b) principalmente per e in
    connessione con specifici prodotti o raccolte di prodotti che
    contengono il Programma, a meno che l'accordo non sia stato
    stipulato, o le licenze di brevetto non siano state rilasciate,
    prima del 28 Marzo 2007.

    Nessuna parte di questa Licenza può essere interpretata come atta ad
    escludere o limitare gli effetti di qualunque altra licenza o altri
    meccanismi di difesa dalla violazione che possano altrimenti essere
    resi disponibili dalla normativa vigente in materia di brevetti.

12. Nessuna resa di libertà altrui

    Se ti vengono imposte delle condizioni (da un ordine giudiziario, da
    un accordo o da qualunque altra eventualità) che contraddicono le
    condizioni di questa Licenza, non sei in nessun modo esonerato dal
    rispetto delle condizioni di questa Licenza. Se non puoi
    distribuire un Programma coperto da questa Licenza per sottostare
    simultaneamente agli obblighi derivanti da questa Licenza e ad
    altri obblighi pertinenti, allora non puoi distribuire il Programma
    per nessun motivo. Per esempio, se accetti delle condizioni che ti
    obbligano a richiedere il pagamento di una royalty per le
    distribuzioni successivamente effettuate da coloro ai quali hai
    distribuito il Programma, l'unico modo per soddisfare sia queste
    condizioni che questa Licenza è evitare del tutto la distribuzione
    del Programma.

13. Utilizzo con la GNU Affero General Public License
            
    Indipendentemente da qualunque altra condizione espressa da questa
    Licenza, hai il permesso di collegare o combinare qualunque
    Programma coperto da questa Licenza con un'opera rilasciata sotto
    la versione 3 della licenza GNU Affero General Public License,
    ottenendo un singolo Programma derivato, e di distribuire il
    Programma risultante. Le condizioni di questa Licenza continuano a
    valere per le parti riguardanti il Programma che sono coperte da
    questa Licenza, mentre le condizioni speciali della GNU Affero
    General Public License, sezione 13, riguardanti l'interazione
    mediante rete, saranno applicate al Programma così risultante.

14. Versioni rivedute di questa Licenza

    La Free Software Foundation può pubblicare delle versioni rivedute
    e/o delle nuove versioni della GNU General Public License di tanto
    in tanto. Tali versioni saranno simili, nello spirito, alla
    presente versione, ma potranno differire nei dettagli al fine di
    affrontare nuovi problemi e nuove situazioni.

    A ciascuna versione viene assegnato un numero identificativo di
    versione. Se il Programma specifica che si applica a sè stesso una
    certa versione della GNU General Public License, "o qualunque altra
    versione successiva", hai la possibilità di sottostare alle
    condizioni di quella specifica versione o di qualunque altra
    versione successiva pubblicata dalla Free Software Foundation. Se
    il Programma non specifica un numero di versione della GNU General
    Public License, puoi scegliere qualunque versione della GNU General
    Public License pubblicata dalla Free Software Foundation.
    Se il Programma specifica che un sostituto o un procuratore può
    decidere quali versioni future della GNU General Public License
    posso essere utilizzate, allora tale scelta di accettazione di una
    data versione ti autorizza, in maniera permanente, ad utilizzare
    quella versione della Licenza per il Programma.

    Versioni successive della Licenza possono garantire diritti
    aggiuntivi o leggermente differenti. Ad ogni modo, nessun obbligo
    aggiuntivo viene imposto agli autori o ai detentori di copyright
    come conseguenza della tua scelta di adottare una versione
    successiva della Licenza.

15. Rinuncia alla Garanzia

    NON C'E' NESSUNA GARANZIA PER IL PROGRAMMA, PER QUANTO CONSENTITO
    DALLE VIGENTI NORMATIVE. ECCETTO QUANDO ALTRIMENTI STABILITO PER
    ISCRITTO, I DETENTORI DEL COPYRIGHT E/O LE ALTRE PARTI FORNISCONO
    IL PROGRAMMA "COSI' COME È" SENZA GARANZIA DI ALCUN TIPO, NE'
    ESPRESSA NE' IMPLICITA, INCLUSE, MA NON LIMITATE A, LE GARANZIE DI
    COMMERCIABILITA' O DI UTILIZZABILITA' PER UN PARTICOLARE SCOPO.
    L'INTERO RISCHIO CONCERNENTE LA QUALITA' E LE PRESTAZIONI DEL
    PROGRAMMA E' DEL LICENZIATARIO. SE IL PROGRAMMA DOVESSE RISULTARE
    DIFETTOSO, IL LICENZIATARIO SI ASSUME I COSTI DI MANUTENZIONE,
    RIPARAZIONE O CORREZIONE.

16. Limitazione di Responsabilità

    IN NESSUN CASO, A MENO CHE NON SIA RICHIESTO DALLA NORMATIVA VIGENTE
    O CONCORDATO PER ISCRITTO, I DETENTORI DEL COPYRIGHT, O QUALUNQUE
    ALTRA PARTE CHE MODIICA E/O DISTRIBUISCE IL PROGRAMMA SECONDO LE
    CONDIZIONI PRECEDENTI, POSSONO ESSERE RITENUTI RESPONSABILI NEI
    CONFRONTI DEL LICENZIATARIO PER DANNI, INCLUSO QUALUNQUE
    DANNEGGIAMENTO GENERICO, SPECIALE, INCIDENTALE O CONSEQUENZIALE
    DOVUTO ALL'USO O ALL'IMPOSSIBILITA' D'USO DEL PROGRAMMA (INCLUSI,
    MA NON LIMITATI A, LE PERDITE DI DATI, LA CORRUZIONE DI DATI, LE
    PERDITE SOSTENUTE DAL LICENZIATARIO O DA TERZE PARTI O
    L'IMPOSSIBILITA' DEL PROGRAMMA A FUNZIONARE ASSIEME AD ALTRI
    PROGRAMMI), ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL DETENTORE O LE ALTRE PARTI
    SIANO STATI AVVISATI CIRCA LA POSSIBILITA' DI TALI DANNEGGIAMENTI.

17. Interpretazione delle Sezioni 15 e 16.

    Se la dichiarazione di garanzia e la limitazione di responsabilità
    fornite precedentemente non hanno effetto legale in un paese a
    causa delle loro condizioni, le corti di giustizia devono applicare
    la norma locale che più si avvicini al rifiuto assoluto di
    qualsivoglia responsabilità civile relativa al Programma, a meno
    che una garanzia o una assunzione di responsabilità scritta non
    accompagni una copia del programma ottenuta dietro pagamento.

                FINE DEI TERMINI E DELLE CONDIZIONI

Come applicare questre condizioni di Licenza ai vostri programmi

Se sviluppi un nuovo programma, e vuoi che esso sia della massima
utilità, il modo migliore è renderlo software libero in modo che
chiunque possa ridistribuirlo e modificarlo secondo i termini di
questa Licenza.

Per fare ciò, allega le seguenti note informative al programma. Il
modo migliore è inserirle all'inizio di ciascun file sorgente, al
fine di rimarcare adeguatamente la mancanza di garanzia; ciascun
file dovrebbe inoltre contenere la dichiarazione di copyright e un
riferimento al posto in cui è possibile ottenere la versione
completa delle note informative.

    &lt;una riga per dire in breve il nome del programma e cosa fa&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;anno&gt; &lt;nome dell'autore&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
    General Public License for more details.
    
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program. If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Inoltre, aggiungi le informazioni necessarie a contattarti via posta
ordinaria o via posta elettronica.

Se il programma interagisce mediante terminale, fai in modo che
visualizzi, quando viene avviato in modalità interattiva, un breve
messaggio come quello che segue:

    &lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
    show w. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
    it under certain conditions; type show c for details. 

Gli ipotetici comandi show w e show c devono visualizzare le parti
corrispondenti della GNU General Public License. Naturalmente i
comandi del tuo programma potrebbero essere differenti; per una
interfaccia di tipo GUI, dovresti usare un bottone "About" o "Info".

Devi inoltre fare in modo che il tuo datore di lavoro (se lavori
come programmatore presso terzi) o la tua scuola, eventualmente,
firmino una "rinuncia al copyright" sul programma, se necessario.
Per maggiori informazioni su questo punto, e su come applicare e
rispettare la GNU GPL, consultare la pagina
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

La GNU General Public License non consente di incorporare il
programma all'interno di software proprietario. Se il tuo programma
è una libreria di funzioni, potresti ritenere più opportuno
consentire il collegamento tra software proprietario e la tua
libreria. Se è questo ciò che vuoi, allora utilizza la GNU Lesser
General Public License anziché questa Licenza, ma prima leggi
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.
